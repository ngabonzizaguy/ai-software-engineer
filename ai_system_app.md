# AI_SYSTEM_PROTOTYPE.md

## Project Overview
AI-driven system capable of assisting in software development. The system should have a **modern, elegant, and user-friendly UI/UX** interface inspired by **Clerk** and **Vite**. This prototype will act as a proof of concept for a larger system while maintaining powerful and focused functionality.

## Steps and Actions

### Phase 1: UI/UX Design

#### Action Plan
1. **Create Mockups**:
   - Use Figma (via its API) to generate design mockups programmatically.
   - If Figma API access is unavailable, generate a design description in JSON or SVG format for manual import.
   - Notify the user in case:
     - Figma API credentials are required.
     - Any action cannot proceed without manual intervention.

2. **Foreseeing Credential Requirements**:
   - During the setup phase, analyze the documentation for Figma or Adobe XD APIs to determine credential requirements.
   - Create a placeholder file structure for storing sensitive data securely:
     ```
     /config/
       figma_api.env  # Placeholder for API keys
       adobe_xd.env   # Placeholder for Adobe credentials (if needed)
     ```
   - Notify the user early in the process with a message:
     ```
     Figma API integration detected. Please add your Figma API key to the /config/figma_api.env file or provide it interactively when prompted. Instructions for obtaining the API key can be found at https://www.figma.com/developers/api.
     ```

3. **Fallback Option**:
   - If unable to access Figma or Adobe XD:
     - Create high-fidelity visual examples using HTML/CSS for direct viewing in a browser.
     - Save output in an easily accessible format.

4. **Approval Checkpoint**:
   - Present the design mockups or code-based previews to the user.
   - Example output:
     - A link to Figma (if API integration succeeded).
     - A downloadable `.svg` or `.json` file for local editing.

### Phase 2: Core System Development

#### Action Plan
1. **Backend and API Integration**:
   - Identify required third-party integrations and analyze their documentation.
   - Examples:
     - Figma API for design automation.
     - OpenAI GPT API for text/code generation.

2. **Foreseeing Credential Requirements**:
   - Set up placeholder files for all API keys and credentials in `/config/`:
     ```
     /config/
       figma_api.env
       openai_api.env
     ```
   - Notify the user when a specific API requires credentials:
     ```
     OpenAI API integration detected. Please add your OpenAI API key to the /config/openai_api.env file. Instructions for obtaining the API key can be found at https://platform.openai.com/signup/.
     ```

3. **Fallback Handling**:
   - If credentials are not provided:
     - Pause the integration process and notify the user.
     - Suggest manual alternatives or defer actions that depend on the API.

4. **Approval Checkpoint**:
   - Provide a working demo of backend functionality.
   - Example:
     ```
     API successfully integrated:
     - /generate-code: Accepts user inputs and returns generated code snippets.
     - /logs: Returns logs for debugging and transparency.
     ```

### Phase 3: Testing and Debugging

#### Action Plan
1. **Setup and Credential Validation**:
   - Validate all required credentials at the beginning of the testing phase.
   - Notify the user if:
     - Credentials are missing.
     - The system cannot proceed without them.

2. **Testing Scenarios**:
   - Test scenarios where credentials are valid and invalid.
   - Verify the system gracefully handles missing or incorrect credentials with user-friendly messages.

3. **Approval Checkpoint**:
   - Provide test case results with clear outcomes.
   - Example:
     ```
     Test Case: Missing Figma API Key
     Result: System notified the user and paused the design generation process.
     ```

## Notes for AI Agents
1. **Credential Management**:
   - Always prepare placeholders for credentials in advance.
   - Notify the user about missing credentials with clear instructions on how to obtain and add them.
   - Do not hardcode sensitive data into the codebase.

2. **User Interaction**:
   - Inform the user at critical decision points, especially when manual intervention or approval is required.

3. **Documentation Handling**:
   - Save all analyzed API documentation for future reference in `/docs/`.
